# MileStoneGameProject

This project was to develop a browser game using javascript, html and css in 2 weeks. The game I personally chose was just a basic RPG with turn based comabt, leveling and shop mechanics. Overall I wanted to include abilities, classes, more enemies and quests as well but due to some time constraints and other personal issues I couldn't include those in a servicible/working quality so I chose not to commit those into this project for the final portion.

This project still taught me a great deal about time management, focusing on goals and working within a scope of features. With all that I've learned I feel my skills at coding, design and project management have improved massively.
